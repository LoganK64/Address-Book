# Address-Book
Graphical Interface made in java that allows users to input their name, address, and phone number and write it to a .csv file. It also allows users to search for items in the .csv and view, update, and delete items found. Made in java using swing. In the future I'd like to be able to use this to talk to an actual database and perform the same functions there.


Running AddressBook.java will create a GUI for users to input or search for data.
data input will be saved into addressbook.csv at the base directory. 
If addressbook.csv does not exist it will be created.
If it does exist it will edit the currently existing one
